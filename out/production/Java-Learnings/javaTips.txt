The line with method name, arguments and with all keywords is known as "Method signature" and the rest of it inside the brackets. this is the method body.
The lines with 'void' are not returning anything. They just print something. To return we need to use "String, int, boolen, etc." 
public: is known as a public modifier. Basically is for to manage visibility of methods and variables.
if we change Method Signature public to private then we will not be able to use  this M.S. in another class. Because it is not going to be visible.
main: name of method
static: Once you removed static from the Method Signature, that means you cannot make a static reference to the non-static method. You cannot invoke this method from another class. It is even not belong to its own class. We can no longer invoke it directly.
